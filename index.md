# Kayla's First Website

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links (Two hashes is a second level heading)

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
